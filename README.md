# A commented SpringBoot 3 backend and Angular Frontend example

## Introduction
This is a sample Spring Boot application. It is intended for new Spring Boot developers 
to help them understand the inner workings of a Spring Boot application. 

This application uses specific characteristics and modules but most of the time we
explore the basics and general concepts by means of concrete implementations.

The architecture consists of an Angular front end with Bootstrap for UX and a Spring Boot 3
REST API backend without security enabled. The backend uses an In-Memory H2 database to demonstrate
Spring Boot Data JPA usage.

You can fork it and start exploring right away and modify the source code to support other
databases and Spring projects.

## How the source code was generated

Most of the source code for this base skeleton was generated from Spring Boot initializr for the backend
and Angular CLI for the front end.

# To Do
- Better organization of source code, separation of front end and back end.
- Spring Security demonstration keeping code clarity
- Unit Testing
- Containers
